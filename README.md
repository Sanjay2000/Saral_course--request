Axios is a promise-based HTTP client that works both in the browser and in a node.js environment. It basically provides a single API for dealing with XMLHttpRequests and node's Http interface.

### Requirements and Installation
If you're using Windows, go through the official site of Nodejs to install it. For Linux-based OS, proceed with the following commands on your terminal.

    sudo apt-get install npm
    npm install axios --save
You do also need to install fs (File System) to access a physical file system, like reading and writing files. To install run the given commands in your terminal.

        npm install fs --save
To run your code, first, open your server port using node file_name.js in your working directory in terminal. And, then you can apply the basic CRUD operations.
